## Project Idea: 
- List of Most Frequently Used Emojis in Group Chats

## Description:
- This is a list that will present the most common emojis used across various group chats such as work, friends, family, etc. Each user logs in and will see a different list based on their group chat and personal usage patterns.

## Why it's ridiculous:
- Emojis are often used in a very funny or dramatic way in casual chats, and focusing on the "most overused" emojis brings a light-hearted touch to the project.

## Features: 
1) User Authentication: Let users log in and see their personalized emoji usage.

2) List of Emojis: The user will have the list of most used emojis in the chats. It will be pulling data from the past chats history.This can be simulated if integration through a real messaging app does not seem viable.

3) CRUD Operations: It can add, delete, or "upvote" those emojis they feel are most overused in the group chats.

4) React Component: A component that will display and manage the emoji list.

5) API: Set up an API to manage the saving, updating, and getting of emoji data.

## Skills Covered in the assignment :
1) Building APIs
2) Work with databases (e.g. MongoDB using Mongoose)
3) React app for frontend display
4) Creating CRUD operations
5) User authentication
6) Maybe integrate with something like Firebase for authentication
